## SME Virtual Network Code of Conduct

**Contact**: [chapters@sme.org](mailto:chapters@sme.org)

As leaders of the SME Virtual Network, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by providing feedback, helping others, posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests and any other activities.

Communication through any of SME Virtual Networks's channels (Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, GitHub, Slack, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this community regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion or level of experience. We expect anyone participating in this community to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct (including any SME Virtual Network leaders), the SME Virtual Network leadership may take action - up to and including permanently banning said member from all SME Virtual Network communication channels and accounts.

If you are subject to or are a witness to unacceptable behavior (even by the SME Virtual Network leadership), or have any other concerns, please email us at [chapters@sme.org](mailto:chapters@sme.org).
