# SME Virtual Network Community Participation Guidelines

We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the
diversity of our global contributors and participants. The SME Virtual Network
welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to
contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such,
we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to
agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help
us create a safe and positive community experience for all.

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to
participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Any other dimension of diversity

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from
development of open-source software to conversing on our chat teams or forums
to collaboratively designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and
actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to
enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual
advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.

## When and How to Use These Guidelines

These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as contributors and
participants of the SME Virtual Network community in all SME Virtual Network
activities, both offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon
following these guidelines in all SME Virutal Network activities and forums,
including but not limited to:

* Working with SME Virtual Network contributors and participants virtually or co-located.
* Representing the SME Virtual Network at public (physical or virtual) events.
* Representing the SME Virtual Network in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages).
* Participating in SME Virtual Network webinars, workshops, walkthroughs, virtual office hours and virtual panel discussions (including "Ask Me Anything").
* Participating in SME Virtual Network-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person meetings, and SME Virtual Network-related correspondence.

## Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.

### Violence and Threats of Violence

Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This
includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a
person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post
other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.

### Personal Attacks

Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a
personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking
someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important
to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such
discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused
on the issue at hand.

### Derogatory Language

Hurtful or harmful language related to:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Other attributes

is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender
that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an
individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t
use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when
asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.

### Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This
includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications
or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or
sexual advances. This includes touching a person without permission, including
sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair,
scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating
another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis
like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing
or distribution of sexualized images or text.

### Disruptive Behavior

Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and
presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:

* ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.
* Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
* Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.
* Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.

### Influencing Unacceptable Behavior

We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the
activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Bad behavior from any SME Virtual Network contributor or participant, including
those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts
to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other
official action) from SME Virtual Network activities are not acceptable and will
be dealt with appropriately.

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated
by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity.
Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
Violation of these guidelines can result in you being ask to leave an event or
online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being
banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in
perpetuity.

In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered
to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences.
False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or
tolerated.
